<h2>This website will tell you a little about me.</h2>

<h3>I have a dog who lives with me</h3>
<p class="herty">I have a dog named Armani who is a bichon frise breed from France. We got him when I was 8 years old for Christmas. My family and I went to Asheville, NC and picked him up. At the time, he was a very small and timid animal. After 8 years with him, he has grown to be bigger and fatter. Bichon Frises are a very loyal and trusting breed. Armani is a great companion for me and I always enjoy having him around.</p>

<h3>My favorite football team is the New England Patriots</h3>
<p class="blank">You can call me a bandwagon all you want. It is not going to change my love and passion for them at all. The current quarterback Tom Brady, is undeniably the best quarterback to ever play the game. Already at 41 years old, he is still competing and doing so well in the NFL. Later this year, he will atend his 3rd straight Super Bowl and 9th overall.My father and I love watching Patriots games together and it is a time that I will always cherish.</p>

<h3>I want to become a politician</h3>
<p> I feel a great sense of pride and responsibility to serve my country because I am the only natural-born American citizen in my family. My parents are from Canada and my grandparents from India. My parents and my older sister moved to America twenty years ago, and all of them are currently green card holders. I believe that it is important to learn about one’s country’s history, beliefs, and to study all of its’ aspects to better understand what that country stands for. Politics is a great career path for someone like me, who wants to make a change within his country and society.</p>

<h3>I currently play soccer at my school</h3>
<p>Soccer is my favorite sport to play. With it being the most played and watched sport in the world, playing it makes me feel that I am playing for a bigger cause and something greater than myself. I find it very enjoyable and fun to play. At my school. my coach does push us really hard but it is for our own benefit. I feel that I am definetly getting the best out of myself every time I play soccer for my school. I will continue to work hard and play as much as I can on the field.</p>
