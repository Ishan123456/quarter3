The follow-up to Mars's successful second album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), it explores genres similar to those of its predecessor, such as soul and funk, while Mars and his team focused on capturing the R&B sound that was very popular in the 1990s, described by the singer as the reason he fell in love with music in the first place.Recording sessions for the album took place between Fall 2015 and September 2016 at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California.The production of the album was handled by newly formed production trio Shampoo Press & Curl, consisting of Mars, Brody Brown and Philip Lawrence.
